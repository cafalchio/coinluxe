## Design

A simple design to keep the focus on the list of cryptocurrencies and the information about it. 

With options of **Light Mode and Dark Mode**

<img src="https://github.com/cafalchio/coinluxe/raw/main/media/readme/home_black.png" width="800" alt="homepage dark">

### Images

The CoinLuxe website incorporates crypto images and crypto data obtained from Coingecko.com through the Coingecko API. To ensure real-time and  accurate information, the crypto data is updated every 10 minutes using a scheduler configured on the Heroku platform.


### Fonts

The fonts used in this project are system fonts to keep the user style and increase loading speed.

### Wireframes

**Original Wireframes** The original wireframes were scatched on paper during the design process.

# Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the project's tasks and issues. 

The link to the project's Github project board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/cafalchio/projects/7)

# Database Schema

PostgreSQL was used to create the database for this project. The database schema can be found below:

![SCHEMA](https://github.com/cafalchio/coinluxe/blob/main/media/readme/all_models.png)

# Security

## User Authentication

Authentication was implemented using Django's built-in authentication system. The authentication system was used to create a custom user model that allows users to sign up and log in to the website. The authentication system was also used to create a custom admin model that allows admin users to log in to the admin site.

Decorators were used to restrict access to certain pages based on the user's role. The decorators used in this project are:

- @login_required: restricts access to the page to logged in users.
- @staff_member_required: restricts access to the page to admin users.

## Form Validation

For security purposes, form validation was implemented in the following forms:

- Login form
- Signup form
- Add to Bag
- Remove from Bag

## Custom error pages:

Custom error pages were created for the following errors:

- 404 - (page not found): Page not found error occurs when the user tries to access a page that does not exist.

  This functionality ensures that the user is redirected to a custom error page when an error occurs.

# Features

# Marketing Strategy

Our marketing strategy revolves around two core pillars: our newsletter and our Facebook page. We believe that by optimizing these channels, we can effectively reach and engage our target audience. Here's how we plan to make it better:

* Engagement: To keep our subscribers engaged, we will introduce interactive elements such as polls, surveys, and quizzes, inviting them to participate actively.

* Personalization: Our newsletters will be tailored to individual preferences and user behavior, ensuring that the content resonates with each recipient.

* Frequency: We will maintain a consistent and well-balanced sending frequency to ensure our newsletters are informative without overwhelming our subscribers.

## SEO

* Our metatags provide a good foundation for SEO:
    <meta name="description" content="CoinLuxe a unique place to buy and sell crypto." />
    <meta name="keywords" content="cryptocurrency, exchange, crypto" />
    <meta name="author" content="Matheus Cafalchio" />
    <title>CoinLuxe</title>

* Robots.txt: Ensure that your robots.txt file is correctly configured to control which parts of your site are accessible to search engine crawlers.

* Sitemap.xml: Create and submit a sitemap.xml file to search engines like Google. This file lists all the pages on your site, making it easier for search engines to crawl and index your content.

* Mobile friendly design

* Page load speed


## Social Media Marketing

Our social media marketing is posted frequently on our facebook account.

## Email Marketing



# Testing

* Testing has taken place continuously throughout the development of the project. Each view was tested regularly. When the outcome was not as expected, debugging took place at that point.

## Python validation

Pycodestyle was tested in all folders. Currently just the management part of the api_backend does not comply with the style in line characters. But the work around to comply would make the code much longer and complicated.  "– sometimes style guide recommendations just aren’t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. " (pep8)

## LightHouse

# Bugs

* During the development there were many bugs, currently there are few known bugs.

- Add Crypto. The Add Crypto form was impossible to fill manually, as it needs all the crypto details that cannot be created. Market related data is based on real data. To work around, a model was created to keep all the cryptos id of cryptos that will be automatically updated by the scheduler.
So once the id is in the list, the data will be added later.

- The site uses the free Coingecko api. However, sometimes due to the free tier, the api call fails and timeout.


# Deployment

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

## Create the Heroku App:
- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next, select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

## Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install dj_databse_url`
    - `pip3 install psycopg2-binary` 
- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- In settings.py file import dj_database_url, comment out the default configurations within database settings and add the following: 

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```
- Run migrations and create a superuser for the new database. 
- Create an if statement in settings.py to run the postgres database when using the app on heroku or sqlite if not

```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
    }
```

- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: `web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi:application`
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list in settings.py in the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

- Push these changes to Github.

## Connecting S3 to Django 
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install boto3`
    - `pip3 install django-storages` 
- Update your requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` and add storages to your installed apps.
- Create an if statement in settings.py 

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

```
- Then add the line 

    - `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'` to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production.


- Create a file called custom storages and import both our settings from django.con as well as the s3boto3 storage class from django storages. 
- Create the following classes:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

- In settings.py add the following inside the if statement:

```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

- and then add the following at the top of the if statement:
```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

- Go to S3, go to your bucket and click 'Create folder'. Name the folder 'media' and click 'Save'.
- Inside the folder, click 'Upload', 'Add files', and then select all the images that you are using for your site.
- Then under 'Permissions' select the option 'Grant public-read access' and click upload.
- Your static files and media files should be automatically linked from django to your S3 bucket.
